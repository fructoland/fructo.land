		Governance
	</h1>

	<p>
		Fructoland is a community-driven project.
		We are open to any suggestions and contributions.
		This way we can make Fructoland better.
	</p>
	<h2 class="text-2xl">
		Token
	</h2>
	<p>
		This is why we have a governance system.
		The Fructoland Token (FRLND) will be used to vote on proposals.
		This token is not yet live, but we are working on it.
	</p>
	<p>
		To join in, you can join our Discord server. We will select
		5 random people from the server to be part of the governance.
	</p>
	<p>
		To earn tokens, you can do the following:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
		<li>
			Having a successful pull request merged into
			any of our GitHub repositories will earn you 1 token.
		</li>
		<li>
			Promoting Fructoland and any of its projects on social media
			will earn you .5 tokens.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		To claim those tokens, you can contact us on Discord.
	</p>

	<p>
		We will also be giving out tokens from time to time,
		so make sure you follow us on social media as we
		will select random people from there to receive tokens.
	</p>

	<p>
		To hold those tokens you will need a wallet that supports
		the ERC-20 standard. We recommend using <a href="https://metamask.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetaMask</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-3xl">
		Voting
	</h2>

	<p>
		Voting will take place on Snapshot, so you don't have
		to worry about gas fees.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our token is hosted on <a href="https://polygon.technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>,
		since gas is cheaper to trade those tokens.
	</p>

	<p>
		We are working hard to prepare for the launch of the token.
		We will be announcing the launch date on our social media.
	</p>
